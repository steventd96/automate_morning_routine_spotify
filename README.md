# automate_morning_routine_spotify

My ideal morning routine is to listen to a random song from my favourite playlist. 
Then, listen to some devotional material and news.

This program allow users to play a random song from their favourite playlist and two podcasts of their choice.

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login and create an account
2. Once done, you will see your client_id and client_secret in the dashboard
3. Go to settings and set your redirect_url (can be anything like google.com)
4. Go to variables_public.py and fill out the variables in the file
  - Note that the song playlistName has to be a playlist of your own. 
  - Choose two podcasts that upload content daily (like news podcasts)
